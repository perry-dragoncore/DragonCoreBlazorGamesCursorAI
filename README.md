# Cursor AI created Games
This was a test using Cursor AI to see how many successfully working games could be made with minimal extra effort to make them work.  
Also using Blazor Webassembly as the technology.

I spent about 3 hours making these games as well as a few that had to be abandoned due to Chat GPT not giving a complete solution or mixed solutions I couldn't get to work without major overhaul.  
Most of my time was getting sounds and generating images.  I wrote almost 0 lines of code using Cursor.

It would be interesting to do this activity again agains the new AI.
